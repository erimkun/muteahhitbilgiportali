# Security Scripts - SQL Injection Testing and Mitigation Report

This folder contains scripts and documentation related to testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities and proposed measures to secure the system against SQL injection attacks.

## Overview

Our system uses SQLite with the `sqlite3` module in Node.js. Database queries are executed using parameterized queries (e.g., using placeholders like `?`). This approach already provides a layer of protection against common SQL injection attacks.

## Testing Script

- **attacks.js**: This script simulates SQL injection attacks by sending malicious payloads to a hypothetical endpoint. It demonstrates what an attacker might try, such as attempting to bypass authentication or execute unauthorized SQL commands.

  **Usage:**
  ```bash
  node attacks.js
  ```
  *Note: Adjust the endpoint URL as needed to target specific parts of your API.*

## Current Security Measures

1. **Parameterized Queries:**
   - All SQL queries in the system use parameterized queries. This means that user inputs are not directly concatenated into SQL statements, reducing the risk of SQL injection.

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Input validation is performed on critical routes. Although further strict validation may be necessary in some areas, basic checks are in place.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Errors related to database operations are properly caught and handled, which minimizes the risk of exposing sensitive error information that could be exploited.

## Potential Vulnerabilities & Mitigation Strategies

Despite these measures, consider the following points:

1. **Endpoint Exposure:**
   - **Risk:** If a test or public endpoint accepts raw input without proper filtering, it might be exploited.
   - **Mitigation:** Ensure that all endpoints validate and sanitize input. Disable or restrict test endpoints in production environments.

2. **Logging Sensitive Information:**
   - **Risk:** Detailed error logs might reveal sensitive database schema or structure information.
   - **Mitigation:** Avoid logging detailed error messages in production. Use generic error messages for client responses.

3. **Database Privileges and Access Control:**
   - **Risk:** If the database user has more privileges than necessary, a successful injection could allow destructive actions.
   - **Mitigation:** Apply the principle of least privilege on the database user. Regularly review and update permissions.

4. **Regular Security Audits:**
   - **Risk:** Over time, changes in the code or dependencies may introduce new vulnerabilities.
   - **Mitigation:** Conduct periodic security audits and code reviews. Utilize automated tools like static analyzers.

5. **Prepared Statements in All Queries:**
   - **Risk:** Any ad-hoc SQL query that does not use parameterization could be vulnerable.
   - **Mitigation:** Audit the entire codebase to ensure all SQL queries use prepared statements.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

- **Adopt ORM or Query Builder:**
  - Consider using an ORM (like Sequelize or Prisma) or a query builder (like Knex) that abstracts raw SQL queries. This can reduce the risk of human error in manual query construction.

- **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
  - For added security, deploy a WAF that can detect and block SQL injection attempts at the network level.

- **Detailed Input Sanitization:**
  - Enhance input validation by using libraries that can sanitize inputs more robustly and define stricter schemas for expected input data.

## Conclusion

The current implementation uses parameterized queries, which is an effective defense against SQL injection attacks. However, continuous vigilance, regular security assessments, and the adoption of additional best practices (such as using an ORM and enhanced endpoint security) will help maintain and improve the system's security posture.
