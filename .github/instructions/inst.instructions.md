Always read the whole code of the project before making any changes. This is especially important for large projects, as you may not be aware of all the interactions between different parts of the code.
If you are unsure about any part of the code, ask for help from the project maintainers or other contributors. It is better to ask questions than to make incorrect assumptions that could lead to bugs or other issues.

When making changes, be sure to follow the project's coding style and conventions. This includes things like indentation, naming conventions, and commenting style. Consistency is important for maintaining a clean and readable codebase.
When testing your changes if the servers need to be restarted, let me know i will do it for you. you can also ask me to run tests for you.
